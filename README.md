## 📄 Project Description

This project automates the provisioning of an Apache web server on an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. It defines infrastructure as code (IaC) to launch and configure an EC2 instance with Apache installed and running, providing a fully functional web server with minimal manual intervention. This setup ensures a repeatable, scalable, and consistent deployment process.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **AWS EC2** – Virtual server in the cloud to host the Apache web server.
- **Apache HTTP Server** – Open-source web server installed on the EC2 instance.
- **User Data Script** – For automatic installation and starting of Apache on instance launch.
- **AWS CLI** *(optional)* – For managing AWS services via command line (if needed for verification).
